    # Prompt Specification Curve Analysis

    *A reproducible tour of how arbitrary prompt choices drive LLM-simulated public opinion.*

    When a researcher asks a language model to simulate a survey respondent, the resulting "public opinion" depends not only on the population that has been described but on a dozen small decisions about how to ask. This notebook is an applied tour of P-SCA, a framework for treating those decisions as the object of study rather than as nuisance parameters. By the time you reach the end you will have constructed prompts interactively, sampled a multiverse of plausible designs, watched a specification curve come together in real time, and seen the single configuration in which a 70-billion-parameter model reports that Republicans want stricter gun laws than Democrats.

    Everything that follows runs on a corpus of 160,035 valid model responses collected in May 2026, shipped alongside this notebook, so no API keys are required.

    Silicon sampling, the practice of using a language model to stand in for a survey respondent, has become an attractive shortcut across political science, marketing, and human-computer interaction. The appeal is straightforward: a few thousand carefully written prompts can, in principle, do the work of a hundred-thousand-dollar survey panel. What the literature has been slower to confront is that the prompt itself is underspecified. Whether the persona is rendered as a bare demographic vignette or as a short narrative biography, whether the question is asked in its original ANES wording or compressed into a Likert anchor, whether the system message tells the model it is helping with academic research or filling out a survey, whether the temperature is set close to zero or closer to one, whether examples accompany the question or not, every one of these choices is plausibly defensible, and together they describe a multiverse of equally reasonable designs that no single paper has the page count to fully report.

    P-SCA borrows specification curve analysis from econometrics, where Simonsohn, Simmons, and Nelson (2020) developed it to expose the sensitivity of empirical estimates to analytical choices, and rebuilds it for the prompt-design problem. The empirical question becomes whether the partisan signal that motivates a silicon-sampling result survives the rest of the multiverse, or whether the headline depends on a small region of design space that the authors happened to occupy.

    Every specification in the P-SCA multiverse is a point in a six-dimensional grid whose axes correspond to the choices most often left implicit in published work. The widget below lets you assemble any point in that grid and see exactly what the API would receive, which makes the abstraction concrete in a way that prose cannot. Change a single dropdown and watch the prompt rewrite itself; the goal is to develop the intuition that "the same question" is, in operational terms, a family of different questions.

    ## Reading the multiverse together

    Pulling the threads together, the picture that emerges is neither an indictment of silicon sampling nor an endorsement of it. The partisan signal on these three items survives between roughly eighty-seven and one hundred percent of defensible prompt designs, which is a real finding and one that nobody could establish from a single configuration; arriving at it required surveying the multiverse rather than walking through it. That stability, however, sits alongside two genuine sources of distortion that the practice of single-spec reporting will continue to obscure. Effect sizes are amplified by something close to a factor of two across systems, so anything that hangs on magnitudes rather than directions is, at present, untrustworthy. And occasional cells, of which Llama under Likert is the most striking, manage to flip the sign of the result entirely, which is exactly the kind of pathology that gets concealed when a paper reports a single number and a justification.
